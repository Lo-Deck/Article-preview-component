## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JS

### What I learned


I learned how to activate a share link when you click on it and change the properties style like `backgroundColor` and `display`.

```js
element.style.display = 'flex';
clickOnIt[0].style.backgroundColor = '#6d7f97';
arrow[0].style.fill = '#fff';

```


### Continued development

Learning from each challenge, I will continue to make website with JS and learning from different challenge from Front-end Mentor.
